Machine Learning Analysis on Housing Prices and Iris Dataset
This repository contains Python notebooks and datasets for machine learning analysis, focusing on housing prices and Iris dataset classification. The project also includes a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and feature analysis.

Repository Structure
1. Datasets
This folder includes two key datasets:
Housing.csv: Dataset containing various features related to housing prices, such as area, number of rooms, and other property attributes. It is used to predict housing prices.
IRIS.csv: The classic Iris dataset containing features of iris flowers (sepal length, petal length, etc.) and their corresponding species.

2. Notebooks
This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for analysis and model building:
HousingPrices.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that explores the housing dataset, performs data preprocessing, and builds a model to predict housing prices based on the given features.
IRIS.ipynb: A notebook that analyzes the Iris dataset, applies classification algorithms, and evaluates the accuracy of predicting Iris flower species.
PCA_Analysis.ipynb: A notebook focused on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimensionality of datasets to make analysis more efficient. The PCA is applied to understand the most important features contributing to variability in data, either on the Iris dataset or other data.

How to Run the Notebooks
Install Dependencies: To run the notebooks, ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries with the following command:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
Run Jupyter Notebook: Use the following command to start Jupyter Notebook and open any of the .ipynb files:

jupyter notebook
You can then navigate to the notebook of interest and explore the code and results.
